    <h2>Disability Insurance</h2>
    <h3>What Is Disability Income Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Your life and future plans could be greatly impacted should you experience an income-interrupting illness or injury and become unable to work. Many believe there's already a fallback plan to protect their income, but often discover that isn't the truth, too late.
        <br>
        Disability Income Insurance (DI) can help by providing a monthly benefit you can use to pay your basic expenses (ex. mortgage, utilities and groceries) in the event of a covered disability.

    <h3>Do I Need Disability Income Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Your income is the foundation to your life. Have you considered what would happen if you suddenly became ill or injured, and couldn't work to earn your income? If it would be near impossible to maintain your standard of living, pay bills, and/or save for the future, then you need Disability Income Insurance.
    </p>
    <h3>Where Do I Start?</h3>
    <p>
        Many people are unfamiliar with DI and don't know where to start when exploring a policy that will fit their needs. Here are some questions you need to ask and important definitions to know when looking for a plan.
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">How much do I need to cover basic monthly expenses (this is your "benefit amount")?</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">How long do I need DI benefits to last (this is your "benefit period")?</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">How long could I go without a paycheck (this is your "elimination period")?</span>

    <h3>What If I Don't Use My Disability Income Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        There exists an optional Return of Premium (ROP) Rider! Available at additional cost, the ROP rider provides DI coverage if you need it, and money back if you don't.
        <br>
        Beginning with the 5th policy year, you may receive a portion of the premiums paid, less any benefits received. From ages 65 to 67, it allows for 100% return of premiums paid, less any benefits received. The policy ends after the return of premium is paid and may not be reinstated.

    <h3>I'm A Business Owner - What About My Company?</h3>
    <p>
        Yes, there is insurance for your business! Often called Business Overhead Expense (BOE), a business expense (BE) policy can help keep your business running by reimbursing you monthly for eligible fixed business expenses should you experience an income-interrupting disability.
    </p>
    <h3>What Does A BOE Cover?</h3>
    <p>
        In the event you cannot work and experience a covered illness or injury, a BOE policy can cover:

        <span class="bullet-text">Employee salaries (Some exclusions apply)</span>
