    <h2>Life Insurance</h2>
    <h3>How Does Life Insurance Work?</h3>
    <p>
        When you pass away, you'll leave behind financial obligations that someone needs to pay. And that's where life insurance comes in. You can get a policy that you pay monthly for in varying amounts. Just make sure it's affordable! As long as the policy is in force, your loved ones will be paid the benefit amount upon your death.
    </p>
    <h3>Do I Need Life Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Do you have loved ones that financially depend on you? Or someone that would need to come out of pocket for your final expenses? Then you need life insurance. Whether you can get ALL they would need, or some, it makes a difference. What matters most is you get coverage that you can afford. We have plans for every budget.
    </p>
    <h3>How Much Do I Need?</h3>
    <p>
        This depends on factors such as your current stage of life, who financially depends on you, and your current financial obligations. The right solution for you will be one that allows a balance between premium costs and plan benefits while meeting your coverage needs. Life insurance can be used to:
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Replace lost wages/income of a wage earner</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Leave an inheritance or transfer wealth</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Help pay off the mortgage</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Pay burial and other final expenses</span>
        <br>

    <h3>What Is Term Life Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Term life insurance pays out a death benefit if you die during the term period. These plans generally provide for a larger amount of coverage for a fixed length of time. Consider your family's financial goals. Would there be enough money for your family to realize these goals without your financial contribution to the home? If you:
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Prefer a lower monthly premium in the short-term in exchange for cash value build up,</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Need coverage for a specific period of time,</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Have loved ones that depend on your income,</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Possess financial obligations that require your income...</span>
        <br>
        then term life insurance may be the right solution for you.
    </p>
    <h3>What Is Whole Life Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Whole life insurance is lifetime coverage. These plans tend to be more costly since they pay out the death benefit if you die at any point in time- as long as premiums are paid. If you:
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Want a death benefit that's guaranteed for the policy's life</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Prefer the same premium amount for life, regardless of health and age</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Desire flexibility with policy loans through cash value accumulation</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Want Living Benefits</span>
        <br>
        <span class="bullet-text">Wish for a stable financial asset on a balance sheet...</span>
        <br>
        then whole life insurance may be the right solution for you.
    </p>
    <h3>What About Return of Premium Term Life Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Return of Premium (ROP) Term life insurance is as the name suggests- it pays out a death benefit if you die during the term, and pays you back your premiums at the end of the term if you don't!
        <br>
        Death benefit amounts range from $50,000 to $500,000. Issue ages are 18 to 60, with term length varying by age and tobacco use. If the policy is in force when the term period ends and terms have been met, 100% of the returnable premium will be paid back to you as an endowment benefit. This benefit returns policy premiums with the exclusion of additional premiums paid for riders, rated policies, policy fees, and modal administrative fees. The  benefit will also be reduced by any outstanding loans or liens, including paid Accelerated Death Benefits, and accrued interest. If you don't like paying for something you may not need, then ROP Term Life Insurance may be the right solution for you.

    <h3>What About Simplified Issue Whole Life Insurance?</h3>
    <p>
        Simplified Issue Whole Life (SIWL) Insurance is as the name suggests- Whole Life Insurance that's simpler to qualify for than other types of life insurance. These plans are perfect for those who are between 45 and 85 years old and looking for $5,000 to $50,000 in coverage.
